                    <p>Hi, I am Masato, a sophomore computer science student at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California.
                        I am aspiring to be a front-end or full-stack engineer, and am currently studying Python, HTML, CSS, Java, Javascript and plan to further my knowledge into Node.js. 
                        I am passionate about user-friendly and aesthetic web-creation, and also am interested in pursuing interest in UI/UX design, Artificial Intelligence,
                        and creating web applications.
                        Outside of programming, I enjoy reading books, biking, playing soccer and volleyball, and listening to hip-hop and Japanese Pop. 
                    </p>
