                Cal Poly San Luis Obispo interested in front-end and back-end web development. This website is a place for me to hone my
                HTML and CSS skills outside of the classroom, and it also contains my blog which has my ramblings, my sideprojects, my resume,
                and a contact section. My other career intersts include UI/UX design as well as Artificial Intelligence.
                Some of my passions outside of Computer Science is Soccer, Beach Volleyball, Arsenal, and Doing outdoor 
                activities. This page will continue to be updated!

                    <p>Python is the first programming language I learned and the one I am most comfortable with. I have created a Reddit Search API through
